      <h3>Overview</h3>
      </p>
      <p>The Home Office of the United Kingdom is the agency responsible for the police, immigration, and the internal security service of Great Britain. The Home Office has created a police and crime data API covering England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (but not Scotland). It is possible to access information related to various local police forces, crime related information, and neighborhood specific information through this API. The API can be queried using HTML GET requests and returns JSON objects.</p>
       <p>This guide will walkthrough the various types of data available through the API and will demonstrate using PHP examples how to make requests for specific types of data and how to process those requests to extract the information.</p>
